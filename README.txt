└───────────┘
• The Single Page Book Project is a pragmatical replacement for 
  "heavy-weight" Content Management Systems. Typical LAMP 
  systems running on physical/virtual hardware are replaced by 
  pure HTML/CSS rendered on web-browsers. Searching capabilities
  are provided locally using any modern web browser 
  (Firefox/Chrome/Edge/...).

• Content data is moved from always online SQL/noSQL databases
  to plain text/HTML files in order to keep documentation at 
  hand for YEARS (or DECADES or CENTURIES).

• Next files is all that needed to create a new Single Page Book Project:

│ Features │
└──────────┘
✓ No coding skills needs. Just familiarity with HTML.

✓ Navigate notes "a la Google maps" by zooming in/out, or 
  "a la Zettlekasten way" by showing related notes.

✓ Since html is just pure text, advanced team-work is supported
  through Git and Git workflows (rollbacks, pull requests, 
  version-branching, ...)

✓ use cases include:
  -  advanced notebook and "super"-sheets.
  -  mind-maps.
  -  control-panels.
  -  project-canvas.
  -  Full books.

✓ No coding skills needs. Just familiarity with HTML.
 
✓ Print to paper support:
  print-paper CSS support, useful for first-lectures (start-to-end) of content
  Ex: Two views of the same content:
  -  Map: https://singlepagebookproject.github.io/IT_notes/Blockchain/ethereum_map.html
  - book: http://www.oficina24x7.com/Blockchain/ethereum_map.pdf

✓ All information is available one click away, and related pages can be
  displayed close to each other.

✓ web friendly. Notebooks searchs by-topic/by-text can be saved as web bookmarks.

✓ Quick classification/search/heat-map using topics.

✓ Designed to avoid the dangerous "UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS":

                             SPB allows writers to put all content in the 
                             front/home page to avoid readers ignore 
                             important information they don't known that
                             they don't know.

✓ Easy backup: Copy your files somewhere else. That's all!!!

✓ Customizable:
  No coding skills needed. Still professionals or hobbyist code developers
  will be able to extend or customize it with easy. Core kernel is about 600
  lines divided in 9 independent "modules" (with most of the code run just
  one at page load).
    
✓ Offline navigation.

✓ Documentation "best-patterns" approach:
 ✓ Put related info close to each other.
 👊 Don't repeat twice. 
 👊 Don't keep information spread ("hidden") amongst hundred of emails,
    posts, chats, words, ....
 👊 Don't use a powerful enterprise search engine to find the documents
    you lost with random results. Do not loose the information in first
    place and keep it clean and classified.
 👊 Don't use proprietary formats for important documentation: <br/>
    HTML will be well supported in any electronic platform and by many
    different working groups for always, propriertary formats will not.

│ Planned  │

• Improve "topic" handling support by:
  - Allowing meta-topics to organize topics.
  - Allow to reuse third party ontologies already developed by experts.

• Predefined documentation topics (TODO, draft, important, review,
  1min/10min/... lecture time,...)

• Allow "development mode" to refresh page when some edition has been
  made to the HTML.

• text description for topics.

• Search by "nearby content" based of similar note-topics.

• Allow to "pop-up" notes in different windows.

│ Planned (Far future) │

• IA help system to automatically tag notes by topics.
