<h3>What's new in version 1.1?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Print to paper support:<br/>
    A printed-book-style is now available, useful for first-lectures (start-to-end) approach<br/>
    Now you can look at info 
    like a <a href="http://www.oficina24x7.com/Blockchain/ethereum_map.html">map</a> or  
    like a <a href="http://www.oficina24x7.com/Blockchain/ethereum_map.pdf">book</a> with Gutenberg seal-of-approval.
    To create a printed book just use your browser "Print..." menu.<br/>
    Or you can also filter out non-interesting content to create sub-books first.<br/>
    Very wide schemas will break, anything else will (hopefully) work.<br/>
</li>
<li>Cleaned Search Interface and keyboard shortcuts now in place.<br/>
    Press key "S" to access the search menu (or "/" for vim supremacists)<br/>
    Also the Search menu can be open automatically with pre-filled search dialog
    with pre-selected topics and/or free text.<br/>
    Contact with <a href="./help.html">HelpMan</a> for examples.
</li>
<li>smoother zoom</li>
<li>and automatic background coloring of divs, offering a visual help while zoomin in/out</li>
<li>Search by text/topics popup can be displayed at page load by just adding the URL parameter '?showSearchMenu'</li>
<li>Search Popup now displays the total number of sections found on each topic. This easely servers
    to evaluate the importance or weight of a given topic on the page/book/map/dashboard/canvas/...(add yours).
</li>
<li>Simple topic topic-counters are in place.<br/>
    Very primitive stat method, but enough to see at a glance what the most
    content-aware cells are, based on number of topics covered.<br/>
    No need to click somewhere of dig into menus to see them, they are
    where they the deserve, on the front-page.
</li>
<li>The SPB and IT_notes have been splited in two different projects.<br/>
    Historically SPB was just a tool to organized my IT notes, after years of
    frustration with wikis, online services, note-keeping apps, ... and for more
    than two years SPB was just extra-stuff around IT_notes. Finally SPB is
    a own project on itself than can be used for general note-keeping/ordering/searching
    on its own.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>IT_Notes Content</h3>
