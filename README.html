<h1>About SPB </h1>
<ul>
    <li>SPB stands for Single Page Book. It aims at unifying books,
       mind-maps and cheat-sheet contents creation in a single web page
       that can be created and updated "a la Zettelkasten" 
       <sup>
         <a href="https://medium.com/emvi/luhmanns-zettelkasten-a-productivity-tool-that-works-like-your-brain-abe2d53a2948" target="_new">1</a>,
         <a href="https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125" target="_new">2</a>
       </sup>
       <b>to keep notes organized and improving throughout years/decades</b> that
       can also be navigated "a la Google Maps".
    </li>
    <li>SPB offers a pragmatical replacement for "heavy-weight"
       Content Management Systems running on complex server setups,
       by using just pure HTML/CSS consumed by web-browsers running
       on a laptop or mobile.
    </li>
    <li>Content data is moved from "always online" databases
      to plain <b>safe HTML files</b> easy to manage and backup without
      complex IT administration skills.
    </li>
    <li>Extra information about How SPB compares with some other content 
        publication and management tools can be read <a href="./index.html">here</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1>Use-cases</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Advanced notebooks</li>
  <li>Cheat-sheets with steroids.</li>
  <li>"Ever growing" mind-maps (make them evolve the way your brain like it).</li>
  <li>Brain-to-brain synchronization: make multiple brains work like a team.</li>
  <li>Project management, canvas and issue-track management.</li>
  <li>"Light" weight database.</li>
  <li>(add your own here)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Micro "How-To"</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Install a light-weight web (HTML) server on your PC.<br/>
        An simple way is to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">download</a>
       and install python 3. Then from the terminal (Linux/Mac) or the command
       prompt (Windows) execute next 3 commands and press Enter key( ‚èé ) to confirm.
       <pre>
Command to execute:                             Explanation
C:\users\myUser > mkdir project01‚èé              ‚Üê [m]a[k]e (or create) new [dir]ectory
                                                where the page will be stored
                                            
C:\users\myUser > cd    project01‚èé             ‚Üê [c]hange [d]irectory

C:\users\myUser > python3 -m http.server‚èé      ‚Üê Execute <b>safe</b> web server pointing
                                                (only our computer will be able to
                                                 access the content server)
       </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Copy next files to the directory where pages will be placed:
        <pre>
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SinglePageBookProject/SPB/master/map_template.html">map_template.html</a>
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SinglePageBookProject/SPB/master/map_v1.css">map_v1.css</a>
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SinglePageBookProject/SPB/master/map_v1.js">map_v1.js</a>
        <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SinglePageBookProject/SPB/master/custom.js">custom.js</a>
        </pre>
        Rename <b>map_template.html</b> to provide a sensible name. All others files just need to be 
        downloaded once. They will be reused again and again.<br/>
        <b>"map_v1.js"</b> contains the minimum Javascript code used to navigate and react 
        to user actions.<br/>
        <b>"map_v1.css"</b> contains the Cascading Style Sheets to "beautify" the content.<br/>
        <b>"custom.js"</b> allows advanced customization. Just leave it next to the other files
        and forget.
    </li>
</ol>


<h1>Features</h1>
<ul>
    <li>‚úì No coding skills needed, just familiarity with HTML.</li>
    <li>‚úì Navigate notes "a la Google maps" by zooming in/out, or 
        "a la Zettlekasten way" by showing related notes by topic and/or direct-link.
    </li>
    <li>‚úì distributed team workflows supported through Git
         (rollbacks, pull requests, versioning, branching, ...)
    </li>
    <li>‚úì Print to paper support:
      print-paper CSS support, useful for first-lectures (start-to-end) of content
      Ex: Two views of the same content:
      -  Map: https://singlepagebookproject.github.io/IT_notes/Blockchain/ethereum_map.html
      - book: http://www.oficina24x7.com/Blockchain/ethereum_map.pdf
    </li>
    <li>‚úì All information available one click away, and related pages can be
         displayed close to each other.
    </li>
    <li>‚úì save searchs/sub-books classified by by-topic/text as URL bookmarks.
    </li>
    <li>‚úì Quick classification/search/heat-map using topics.</li>
    <li> ‚úì Designed to <b>avoid the dangerous "UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS"</b>:<br/>
         SPB is designed to show all related information as close as possible to 
         each other as to avoid missing unknown-unknowns. <br/>
          As an example, this is how Google presents QA (Quality Assurance) when
          search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=java+qa" target="_blank">
          JAVA QA related results</a> and this is how SPB presents the same
          <a href="https://singlepagebookproject.github.io/IT_notes/JAVA/java_map.html?topics=qa"
             target="_blank">JAVA QA related results</a>.<br/>
         <b>Even if Google has access to millions of different pages, it tends to
             be biased toward just an very small subset of content</b>. In particular,
         that related to automated acceptance tests.<br/>
           This probably explain why Java newbies guided by Google results tend to
         do buggy JAVA applications and, since Google page-rank favors most linked 
         pages the biased search mechanism feeds ad infinitum. <br/>
           SPB JAVA notes, manually collected&amp; classified throughout the time,
         will always present all QA related information with no bias. 
           There are no reasons to suppose that automated testing is less or 
         more imporant than other QA topics related to async programming, internal 
         data collection management or persistence tools. By presenting them all 
         in parallel we decrease the danger of unknown-unknowns.
      </pre> 
    </li>
    <li>‚úì Easy backup: Copy your files somewhere else, attach to an e-mail, That's all!!!
    </li>
    <li>‚úì Offline navigation.</li>
    <li>‚úì Documentation "best-patterns" approach:<br/>
      <ul>
        <li> üëä Put related info close to each other.</li>
        <li> üëä Don't repeat twice. </li>
        <li> üëä Don't keep information spread ("hidden") amongst hundred of emails,
           posts, chats, words, ....  </li>
        <li> üëä Don't use a powerful enterprise search engine to find the documents
        you lost with random results. Do not loose the information in first
        place and keep it clean and classified.
        </li>
        <li> üëä Don't use proprietary formats for important documentation: <br/>
        HTML will be well supported in any electronic platform and by many
        different working groups for always, proprietary formats will not.
        </li>
