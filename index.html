<ul>
    <li><b>Note taking apps like Evernote:</b><br/>
        Evernote (and others) are high-level user visual apps.
        They use some form of propietary database format
        to store the content and propietary services to synchronize the
        content. <br/>
        On the other side SPB follows the philosophy that the database formal
        must be as simple as possible. Actually is plain HTML (that's, text files).
        This makes of it a much less friendly app for newcomers, but allows
        to reuse many powerful tools like existing text editors, or
        synchronization mechanisms.<br/>
        The application itself reduces to the embedded JavaScript.<br/> 
        It also allows for "complex" things like embedding SVG images,
        videos, iframes or any other technology supported by modern browsers,
        or extend it with standard JavaScript.<br/>
        SPBs <b>can be embedded/integrated with easy in existing Web sites, Evernotes can NOT</b>.
        <br/>
        Since version 1.1 <b>SPBs allows to create printed books (or sub-books) of the content</b>,
        again by just profiting from standard CSS technology in any modern browser.
        <br/>
        <b>SPBs allows for collaborative work and version control through systems like
            Git, Evernotes doesn't.</b>
        <br/>
        Probably "normal" users will be happy enough with Evernote while
        advanced users who feel comfortable with text editors and git
        and/or wants to enhance the power of their web-sites will prefer the
        SPB format.<br/>
   </li>
   <li><b>PowerPoint presentations</b><br/>
       Metaphorically speaking, if <b>Power Point is an Apple Store of documentation 
       in Fifth Avenue</b> where iphones are sold, <b>the SPB is the Apple 
       factory in Asia</b> where document information is stored, assembled and tested.<br/>
   </li>
   <li><b><a hre="https://learnxinyminutes.com/" target="_new">Learn X in Y Minutes</a></b>
       "alike" sites.<br/>
       Learn X in Y minutes (and others like <a href="https://cheat.sh">cheat.sh</a>)
       have surged to create a "learn-fast" path for newcomers. They make a great
       job for what they have been designed. Still they will fail once we try
       to get deeper into any complex technology and they don't provide tooling
       like "search-by-topic" in SPB. Learning data-science or IA or modern
       language programming is not about one cheat-sheet, but about many 
       inter-related ones.<br/>
       SPB can be used to create a better "learn X in Y minutes". <br/>
       This is how learn x in y minutes :
       <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/" target="_new">presents java to newcomers</a> and this is how SPB 
       <a href="http://www.oficina24x7.com/JAVA/java_map.html" target="_new">presents java to newcomers and seniors developers</a>
   </li>
   <li><b>Zettelkasten knowledge and info management</b>.<br/>
       <a href="https://www.qwant.com/?q=Zettelkastenw&t=web">Zettlekasten</a> follows a set of
       patterns for advanced documentation and note-taking.<br/>
       Actually SPB do not compares to, but can be used as a way for "Zettelkasten"ing.<br/>
       Some tools have been developed for Zettelkasten. With SPB, the tool is your browser!.<br/>
       Actually "Zettelkasten"ers looks to like the SPB format according to
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/">some comments in reddit</a>.
   </li>
   <li><b>Content Management Systems (CMS)</b>.<br/>
         A CMS is an application running 24x7 in a server "somewhere in the Internet".<br/>
       The SPB is NOT a server or any other type of software, just plain HTML (OK, and 
       some spots of JavaScript and CSS). <br/>
         The content on a CMS is stored in a central database running also "somewhere in the Internet"<br/>
       The content on a SPB is the HTML file in your local hard-disk. Since it's HTML (plain text)
       you can use some tool like git to put on a central or distributed system (and branch, fork or
       collaborate with your team). <br/>
        CMS is more user-friendly ... once you have a server running 24x7, and some CMS
       admin is out there to "keep it alive" and the network is up and there are backups in 
       place and users agree of common usage pattern, and someone/somebody takes charge of 
       cleaning repeated information and same topics are used by anyone, and users are notified
       of other users changes ... and users don't get used to think that the CMS is a place
       to "pile" random word and powerpoint files and care is taken to avoid repeated content 
       in different places (or even worse, different versions of the same content anywhere)
       OK, you know, CMS most of the times does not work as planned. 
       It requires lot of attention and discipline by end users (and CMS administrators).<br/>
   </li>
   <li><b>Wikis</b>.<br/>
       SPB can be seen as a lightweight Wiki. Actually Wikis can be seen as lightweight CMSs.<br/>
       A Wiki usually also need a server running 24x7 and Wiki operators to maintain it.<br/>
       Similar advantages / disadvantages than in the CMS should apply. Actually the Wikipedia
       is the only Wiki/CMS I'm aware that run as expected once they managed to have 
       a server running 24x7, and some CMS admin is out there to "keep it 
       alive" and the network is up and there are backups in place and users agree of 
       common usage pattern, and someone/somebody takes charge of cleaning repeated 
       information and same topics are used by anyone,
   </li>

   <li><b>Plain  TXT and "Notepad" note taking</b><br/>
       Important things (those that affects thousands of millions of people every day) 
       are <a target="_new" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">written down in txt</a>. <br/>
       HTML and by extension SPB, also likes txt. Just put your important staft inside
       &lt;pre zoom&gt; tags (pre: pre-formatted).
   </li>

   <li><b>Canvas like boards</b><br/>
       With some minor training on how to layout elements, SPB can also be used as a 
       simple canvas-like application (and again, being pure HTML/txt, you can profit from
       all the "goodies" of git to version or branch your project canvas).<br/>
       With good programming skills it can also be used as a complex canvas-like board,
       by just rendering the HTML "somehow" from a remote server.</li>

   <li>Git to WiKi like systems. As of 2021 more companies are realizing about the 
       advantages of using the git-to-wiki approach to replace complex CMS with their
       internal complex databases. (historical note: SPB is 3+ years ahead of them).
       The main difference is that a SPB is a final result, while most git-to-wiki
       systems still need some type of setup and not-so-complex devops pipelines to
       transform content in git to HTML content. The advantage is that it makes much
       easier to collaborate for "big" number of users in a same content.
       See next article as a refence on how Mozilla has changed its database for a 
       git repository to simplify its documentation pipeline:
       <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/01/yari-mdn-new-doc-platform/" target="_new">
         https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/01/yari-mdn-new-doc-platform/ 
       </a>
       Probably this is the best approach for "huge" documentation projects with
       potentially thousands of users collaborating in related content, while SPB 
       is better for free riders and small workgroups.
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Digging into SPB</h2>
  SPB profits from all the excellent work invested in modern
  Web Browsers to provide static and dynamic content:<br/>
  A modern browser can parse and render tens of megabytes of HTML per second,
  and Internet connection is fast enough to play video, so loading page-by-page
  does not make sense anymore.  The cost of a new page requests is much higher
  than the cost of keeping everything in memory.  Also offline navigation comes for
  free.
  <br/>
   Current web sites (and electronic book formats) follow the page-by-page
  inherited from printed-paper. Actually being able to zoom in/out "a la Google
  Maps" provides a much comfortable UI in electronic devices. Starting from a zoom-out
  and arranging content properly provides a mind-map of the information for free.
  <br/>
  In practice a SPB book is just a single web page profiting from a thoroughly 
  designed CSS and some helper JavaScript.<br/>
