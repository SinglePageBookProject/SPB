<h2 id="title01">SPB compared to ...</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h2 right>... advanced note-taking apps (Evernote, ...)</h2>
  <p>
    Evernote (and others) are friendly visual apps targeting any type
    of user. Those apps use some form of propietary database format
    to store the content and propietary services to synchronize it.
  </p>
  <p>
     On the other side SPB follows the philosophy that the <b>storage format
    must be as simple and safe as possible</b> to be sure 10 years from now we
    have zero problems to recover the information written inside or copy/export
    it to a different device or platform. <br/>
      The internal format of SPB is HTML (plain-text mixed with plain-text tags).<br/>
    (It takes a couple of hours to master the basics of HTML, and then you can
    use it for the rest of your life).<br/>
      Even in the abscence of a web-browser the documentation in an HTML SPB
    project can be consulted with text editor like Notepad, vim, Ultraedit or
    Word and transformed with easy to other formats.<br/>
    This is how a "Notes on Java" SPB
    <a href="https://singlepagebookproject.github.io/IT_notes/JAVA/java_map.html?showSearchMenu=true" target="_blank">looks like</a>,
    and this is how its corresponding text/HTML internal source format
    <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SinglePageBookProject/IT_notes/master/JAVA/java_map.html" target="_blank">looks like</a>.<br/>
      If some hardware error corrupts the HTML file, much of information can
    still be recovered. This is mostly impossible with binary propietary formats.<br/>
  </p>
  <p>
      Editing content with HTML (vs WYSIWYG note-taking apps) is less friendly
    for newcomers, but it's (much) faster once used to the minimal HTML syntax,  
    specially once we get used to some of the many powerful free and commercial
    tools available on the wild. The adquired HTML knowledge gained while editing
    SPB documentation, is also reusable in many other contexts like e-commerce,
    or digital publishing.<br/>
     Also by using standard HTML, SPB documents can also integrated with easy with any
    other HTML content, for example, allowing to add to
    <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery" target="_blank">business-charts</a>,
    auto-generated HTML reporting outputs, video content, ... .<br/>
      <b>This is not possible with propieratry tools/formats</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since version 1.1 <b>SPBs allows to create printed books (or sub-books) of the content</b>,
    again by just profiting from standard (CSS) technology in modern browsers.
  </p>
  <p>
     HTML formats allows also to share the information as e-mail or chat attachments,
    or integrate into distributed (high-tolerant to hardware&amp;network failures)
    version control systems like Git for collaborative, distributed and offline work.<br/>
    <b>This is not possible with propieratry tools/formats</b>.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    Probably "normal" users will be happy enough with apps like Evernote, but
    once they want something more "advanced" and gain control, they will prefer
    the power of standard Web technologies like SPB.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <h2 right>... PowerPoint presentations:</h2>
  <p>
    Metaphorically speaking, if <b>Power Point is an Apple Store of documentation 
  in Fifth Avenue</b> where i-Phones are sold, <b>the SPB is the Apple 
  factory in Asia</b> where document information is stored, assembled and tested.<br/>
  </p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>From the writer's point of view, quick (1-hours) presentations can be done
        on Power Point. Storing the knowledge acquired over the years in different
        interrelated topics requires "something else". SPB is this "something else".
    </li>
    <li> From the reader point-of-view, a Power Point can be enough to put attention,
         then an SPB will be needed to make sensible decisions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <h2 right>... Learn X in Y Minutes (<a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/" target="_new">Link</a>):</h2>
    Learn X in Y minutes (and related ones like <a href="https://cheat.sh">cheat.sh</a>,
    <a href="https://github.com/undergroundwires?tab=repositories&q=bullet&type=&language=">
        "bullet points"</a>, ...) have surged to create a "learn-fast" path for newcomers
    with few free time.<br/>
    <b>They make a great job for what they have been designed. </b>
      Still such projects fall short once we try to get deeper since there is no
     easy way to relate growing information in different places.<br/> 
      Learning data-science or IA or modern language programming is not 
    about one cheat-sheet, but about many inter-related ones.<br/>
    SPB can be used to create extended "learn X in Y minutes" covering the
    basics, the details, and the ecosystem around, and making all the information
    easier to retrieve. <br/>
    This is how "learn-x-in-y-minutes"
    <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/" target="_new">presents java to newcomers</a> and this is how SPB 
    <a href="http://www.oficina24x7.com/JAVA/java_map.html" target="_new">presents java to newcomers and seniors developers</a>.
<li>
  <h2 right>... Zettelkasten knowledge and info management:</h2>
    <a href="https://www.qwant.com/?q=Zettelkastenw&t=web">Zettlekasten</a> follows a set of
    patterns for advanced documentation and note-taking.<br/>
    Actually SPB do not compares to, but can be used as a way for "Zettelkasten"ing.<br/>
    Some tools have been developed for Zettelkasten. With SPB, the tool is your browser!.<br/>
    Actually "Zettelkasten"ers looks to like the SPB format according to
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/">some comments in reddit</a>.
</li>
<li>
<h2 right>... Content Management Systems (CMS):</h2>
    A CMS is an application running 24x7 in a server "somewhere in the Internet".<br/>
  The SPB is NOT a server or any other type of software, just plain HTML (OK, and 
  some spots of JavaScript and CSS). <br/>
    The content on a CMS is stored in a central database running also "somewhere in the Internet"<br/>
  The content on a SPB is the HTML file in your local hard-disk. Since it's HTML (plain text)
  you can use some tool like git to put on a central or distributed system (and branch, fork or
  collaborate with your team). <br/>
   CMS is more user-friendly ... once you have a server running 24x7, and some CMS
  admin is out there to "keep it alive" and the network is up and there are backups in 
  place and users agree of common usage pattern, and someone/somebody takes charge of 
  cleaning repeated information and same topics are used by anyone, and users are notified
  of other users changes ... and users don't get used to think that the CMS is a place
  to "pile" random word and powerpoint files and care is taken to avoid repeated content 
  in different places (or even worse, different versions of the same content anywhere)
  OK, you know, CMS most of the times does not work as planned. 
  It requires lot of attention and discipline by end users (and CMS administrators).<br/>

</li>
<li>
<h2 right>... Wikis:</h2>
       SPB can be seen as a lightweight Wiki. Actually Wikis can be seen as lightweight CMSs.<br/>
       A Wiki usually also need a server running 24x7 and Wiki operators to maintain it.<br/>
       Similar advantages / disadvantages than in the CMS should apply. Actually the Wikipedia
       is the only Wiki/CMS I'm aware that run as expected once they managed to have 
       a server running 24x7, and some CMS admin is out there to "keep it 
       alive" and the network is up and there are backups in place and users agree of 
       common usage pattern, and someone/somebody takes charge of cleaning repeated 
       information and same topics are used by anyone,
</li>
<li>
<h2 right>... Plain TXT files:</h2>
  Important things (those that affects thousands of millions of people every day) 
  are <a target="_new" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793">written down in txt</a>. <br/>
  HTML and by extension SPB, also likes txt. Just put your important staft inside
  &lt;pre zoom&gt; tags (pre: pre-formatted).
</li>
<li>
<h2 right>... Canvas like boards:</h2>
  With some minor training on how to layout elements, SPB can also be used as a 
  simple canvas-like application (and again, being pure HTML/txt, you can profit from
  all the "goodies" of git to version or branch your project canvas).<br/>
  With good programming skills it can also be used as a complex canvas-like board,
  by just rendering the HTML "somehow" from a remote server.</li>
</li>
<li>
<h2 right>... Git to WiKi like systems:</h2>
  As of 2021 more companies are realizing about the 
 advantages of using the git-to-wiki approach to replace complex CMS with their
 internal complex databases. (historical note: SPB is more than 3 years ahead 
 of them).<br/>
 <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/01/yari-mdn-new-doc-platform/" target="_new">
   This link</a> explains how Mozilla has changed its SQL database for a 
 git repository to maintain its documentation and how such change
 has permitted to increase the number of potential contributors, simplified
 the infrastructure and maintenance of the system.<br/>
    The main difference is that a SPB is a final solution, while most
 git-to-wiki systems still need some type of setup and extra setup steps to
 transform content in git to a final HTML content.<br/>
   git-to-wiki is a better approach when hundreds or thousands of writers
 are expected on the same document, while SPB (a single HTML file) is simpler when
 just a few writers work together.<br/>
   Advanced users with some minimal script experience (bash, python,...), can 
 also generate SPBs as the output of a batch or script execution to have all the
 advantages of git-to-wiki systems for free, while normal users just need to expend
 a couple of hours learning the basics of HTML.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<h2 right>... Issue and Project Tracking Software (JIRA):</h2>
     SPB was not designed with the intention of creating a project-tracking software.
   Nevertheless daily ussage probes that it offers a light platform to track
   projects, issues or deadlines <a href="./demo_project_tracker.html" target="_blank">
   with little effort</a> by just choosing the appropiate topics to classify the
   content.<br/>
    Using SPB avoid set-up and maintenance of complex infrastructure
   (again, no need for databases and JIRA servers running and serving request)
   and gets rid of opinionated workflows and data internal opaque schemas (just look
   at the <a href="https://singlepagebookproject.github.io/IT_notes/ProjectManagement/map.html?topics=diagram&query=jira.summary" target="_blank">
   Entity-relationship internals of JIRA</a>) that many times stand in they
   way instead of helping to manage projects. <br/>
     Of course, integration of the Tracking Software with the Content Managament
   System is straightforward (actually it can be the same document) and so it
   is integration with Git. Just as a reference, <b>the plugin to make the JIRA project
   tracking system integrate with the Confluence tracking system is larger than
   the full Javascript code used in SPB. On top of that JIRA and Confluence
   need one or more servers running a SQL database, a 1Gigabyte JAVA SDK, and 
   two separate processes for JIRA and Confluence, each of them running "many" parallel
   threads, even before starting to write a single ticket.</b>
     Tracking systems like JIRA do not ussualy provide a clean mechanism to check
   "who-changed-what", something that makes <b>tracking other people's progress very
   problematic and cumbersome</b>.<br/>
    By contract, when using SPB, we let Git track changes:<br/>
    <b>Git provides to documentation the same service that blockchain provides to money</b>.
   It keep a trace of all changes and how a given data (some note in git, some
   account balance in blockchain) evolved over time to arrive to the current state.
   It's used by all major software companies (Google, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, ...) 
   to track their most valuable assets, source-code. <br/>
     Most probably you are reading this page in github, a git hosting service frequently
   used to track code ... and documentation.

   <div style="margin:1em 0 0 2em; outline: 1px solid grey; padding: 1em;">
     <b>Author's Personal note</b>: I still have nightmares with a old project 
   where the scrum "master" liked to play with JIRA customizing it in a millions
   of non-standard ways that only he was aware of, using magic (and useless) 
   plugins.<br/>
     Worst at all, the system was constantly down or irresponsive. And <b>this
   complex structure and buggy solution was used to update just about 2-3 tickets
   per-week per-user on average</b>. <br/>
